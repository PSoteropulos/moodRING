Paul Soteropulos, December 2022 Solo Project Proposal

moodRING-

App for a user to post an embedded spotify song theyre listening to, along with a description of the mood it invokes, as well as a color selector to capture what that mood feels like for them. The app will be created in MERN. Some of the concepts I am not terribly familiar with and plan to explore: will be utilizing the Spotify API to, at the very least, embed the posted song, but hopefully to search for the song as well and then embed it. I plan on having a working login and registration- with personalized user data, and secured routes only accessible if logged in. I will also be utilizing either bootstrap or tailwind (I do not have much experience with CSS libraries). I would like to explore more fleshed out front end flash as well, with a color selector for the user's mood and possibly some CSS/JS animation.

CRUD functionality- user will be able to create posts (with the aforementioned fields), view all of their posted "moods" on their dashboard feed (may be able to view everyone's posts as well- still deciding what is doable in the timeframe and what to backlog), update the mood and color for their posted song, and delete the post as well
